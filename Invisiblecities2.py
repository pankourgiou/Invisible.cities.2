Invisible_cities = """ Nemorosa is built entirely within a forest of silver-leafed trees. Its streets are not paved, but woven from fallen petals and the gentle coils of mist. Houses here are no more than outlines of form: a table of stone under a canopy of vines, a bed framed by low moss walls, a lantern hung from a cedar's bough. The citizens do not carve space into architecture but allow space to reveal the intention of shelter.

At the center of Nemorosa stands the Tree of Echoes. Each of its leaves carries a sound once spoken within the city: lullabies, confessions, the brittle laughter of old women, the questions children whisper to the moon. These sounds hang like dew and may be heard again by those who sit in silence beneath its roots.

In Nemorosa, time does not proceed, it gathers. Events are not measured by clocks but by the blooming of the wood-anemones and the turning of moths. The past, in Nemorosa, is a lake in which the present wades ankle-deep. All memories are communal, stored in the pattern of lichens on the bellies of old stones.

Travelers come to Nemorosa seeking to remember something they never knew they'd forgotten. And though they leave with empty hands, their dreams from then on are filled with forests that hum like forgotten lullabies.
Let me tell you of Virelia, the city of mirrors and tides.

Virelia stands on a shore where the sea never rests. Each morning, the tide sculpts its streets anew, carving alleys into the sand, polishing the stone of the plazas, and flooding the lower arcades with translucent light. But the city does not resist this; it has learned to live in rhythm with forgetting.

Its buildings are made of reflective glass and quicksilver, so that Virelia is always watching itself. Each wall returns your image altered: one shows you as a child with salt still drying on your cheeks; another reveals the face you will wear in dreams yet to come. There is a dome of obsidian near the harbor, where each visitor must stand and look at themselves until they no longer recognize who is watching.

No maps are drawn of Virelia, for its form shifts with the sea’s moods. The citizens—who wear robes sewn with fish scales and bells—are said to know the city not by sight but by memory of scent, salt, and shadow. They do not build homes, only shelters of silk and driftwood that dissolve at the year’s highest tide, as if to remind themselves that permanence is vanity.

At night, Virelia glows with pale lamps set adrift in shallow bowls. These lanterns float through the flooded streets, guided by small frogs with golden eyes who know the paths beneath the water. The light they cast is not for seeing, but for dreaming.

Some say Virelia is the city where reflections go when they abandon their originals. Some say it is not a city at all, but the memory of one. But no one leaves Virelia unchanged: they carry it forever as a shimmer behind the eyelids, a rhythm in the pulse, a longing to be mirrored and remade.

Lunara, the City of Breaths
Lunara is built on platforms suspended in air, each floating just slightly above the one before, like notes ascending a scale. The city's buildings are hollow, echo chambers where the wind composes symphonies from the breath of its inhabitants. Speech is rare here; instead, the citizens exhale intentions, sigh lullabies, whisper farewells into clay flutes hung from the eaves. To walk Lunara's stairless paths is to float, not by magic, but by surrender.

Velithea, the City of Unfinished Doors
Velithea is a city of doors, all ajar, all leading elsewhere. Some open to familiar rooms: a grandmother’s kitchen, a childhood classroom. Others lead to deserts where no footprints hold, or staircases spiraling inward. The citizens never close doors. They live in the in-between, setting tables beside thresholds, holding conversations across jambs. Visitors find themselves walking endlessly, never quite sure whether they’ve arrived or only just begun leaving.

Corundra, the City of Polished Silence
Everything in Corundra is made of mineral and crystal—floors of amethyst, fountains of hematite, rooftops that shimmer like moonstone. The city sings not with voices but with resonance. Shoes must be removed at the gate. The people speak in gestures, their movements carving invisible calligraphy in the air. Even the markets hum quietly with the music of weight and tension. Each silence in Corundra is cut and set like a gem.

Orlona, the City Whose Sky Lies Beneath
Orlona was built upside-down. Its towers descend into a mirrored lake, its bridges curve below, and its plazas hang from the clouds. The real city is not what you walk upon but what you see reflected. The citizens never look up—they study the water to know who has entered, who has wept, who has changed. To visit Orlona is to learn to walk carefully, for each ripple writes history anew.

Thelyra, the City That Hears Itself
Thelyra is built of bronze and vine, and all its structures resonate. The city has no written laws; instead, every sound is archived in stone coils buried beneath the streets. If a crime is committed, the city remembers it in tone. Its walls can murmur the precise inflection of a broken promise, the sigh before betrayal. The guilty often confess not to justice, but because the city sings their lie back to them in perfect pitch.

Mireya, the City of Soft Edges
No straight lines exist in Mireya. The roads are arcs, the windows ovals, the corners softened by generations of brushing hands. Nothing in Mireya is loud, sharp, or certain. Its citizens walk slowly, turning twice before speaking. Children learn to draw circles before letters. Even its memories are curved, returning again and again to the same point but from different angles. Mireya is the city where nothing ends, only rounds a bend.

Caldrith, the City of Forgotten Oaths
Every building in Caldrith is marked with a single word: the remnant of a vow once made and later abandoned. Walls bear inscriptions like “return,” “never,” “someday.” The people of Caldrith wear robes stitched with names they no longer remember. When it rains, the ink of these words drips into the gutters and flows toward the sea. Travelers often come here to forget, and find instead a deeper kind of remembering.

Saphra, the City Woven from Light
Saphra exists only at dawn and dusk, when the slanted sun weaves gold into the mist that clings to its arches. The city is composed of translucent filaments strung between trees and hills, flickering briefly into form. The people of Saphra are weavers of light and shadow; they mend cracks in reality with threads spun from star-touched gossamer. Stay too long and you, too, may become translucent, until you can no longer tell where your outline ends and the city begins.
